          <h2 id="acceptance">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>By accessing or using the OmniGo application ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use the Service. These Terms apply to all users, including customers and store owners. These terms may also be subject to additional terms and conditions specific to your region. By using the Service, you confirm that you are legally eligible to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h2 id="accounts">2. User Accounts</h2>
          <p>To use the full features of our Service, you must create an account. We offer two types of access:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pi Account Login:</strong> By logging in with your Pi Network account, you can make payments using Pi coins. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Pi account.</li>
            <li><strong>Guest Mode:</strong> You can browse stores and products as a guest. However, you will not be able to place orders or make payments.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You are responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The accuracy and timeliness of the information you provide.</li>
            <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and any passwords.</li>
            <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
            <li>You are fully responsible for any activity that occurs under your account.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="services">3. Our Services</h2>
          <p>OmniGo provides a platform that connects users with local stores ("Stores") to order products and services. You expressly understand and agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>OmniGo acts as a technical intermediary between you and independent stores. We do not own, operate, or control the quality, safety, or legality of any products offered, or the accuracy of store listings.</li>
            <li>Any contractual relationship regarding the sale or delivery of products is established directly between you and the store only. We are not a party to those transactions.</li>
            <li>We do not verify the identity of all users or the accuracy of their information. We rely on the accuracy of the information provided by users and store owners.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="payments">4. Payments and Transactions</h2>
          <p>All payments for orders are processed through the Pi Network. By placing an order, you authorize the transaction through the Pi SDK. OmniGo does not store your private wallet keys or secret phrases. We only record transaction details (ID, amount, status) for order fulfillment and support. In addition to the product price, you may be subject to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Delivery Fee:</strong> Determined independently by the stores and displayed upon request.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for any applicable taxes associated with your transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Subject to each store's refund policy. We assist in facilitation, but the final decision rests with the store.</li>
          </ul>
